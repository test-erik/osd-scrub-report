# osd-scrub-report
Show information about the current Ceph Scrub situation

## Scrub Report
This script shows information about the current Scrubbing in Ceph. It is useful to determine how many deep scrubs are working or waiting and what they are currently doing.

## Author
This script is a Perl Rewrite of an AWK script published by *Frank Schilder* on the Ceph Users mailing list: https://lists.ceph.io/hyperkitty/list/ceph-users@ceph.io/thread/YUHWQCDAKP5MPU6ODTXUSKT7RVPERBJF/

## Why a rewrite?
I wanted to expand the script and do not speak AWK.

## Future:
